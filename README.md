### Game overview

This is my own re-creation of the classic Space Invaders game.

Space Invaders is one of the most addicting games. The idea of the game is very simplistic. You are a space ship who must destroy the invading enemy space aliens as they descend. Use the [SPACE] bar to fire your gun and the arrow keys to move right and left.


### Controls
- Space ship movements: Arrow keys ← →
- [SPACE] bar to fire your gun

### Game Instructions

1. The game begins with a welcome screen which introduces the game as well as providing instructions. The game is started by clicking on the "Start Game" button.
